# MHXXSwitchSaveEditor
A save editor for Monster Hunter XX Switch and 3DS versions
NOT TESTED THOROUGHLY ALWAYS MAKE A BACK UP
THERES ALWAYS A CHANCE THIS COULD RUIN YOUR SAVE

USAGE:
1. Extract MHXX/MHGU save file with your save manager (switch tested with Checkpoint)
2. Open the "System" or "System_Backup" file with this editor
3. Edit all you want.
4. Save to the "System" file to see the changes in-game. Only save to "System_Backup" if you have other backup copies set aside.
5. Place both the edited "System" and "System_backup" back on the sd card of your switch
6. Import the save with your save manager

CONVERTING: 
Note: this only works for MHXX saves (not MHX or MHGen)
1. Start by loading the 3DS save file.
2. In the convert menu select "To Switch"
3. Select your extracted switch save file (just an empty one, needs to be created by your switch)
4. Save the file and import it on the switch

Do not change the name of the saves, keep them system and system_backup
